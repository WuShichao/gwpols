Code and additional material related to the paper on _Parametrizing gravitational-wave polarizations_ (Isi 2022). The paper reviews the formalism of gravitational wave (GW) polarizations as it pertains practical data analysis applications, and derives a variety of useful parameterizations and corresponding Jacobians.

Python code used to produce most of the figures in the paper can be found in the `notebooks/` directory; the remaining plots were produced using [TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) based on the Tex files in `fig/`. Additionally, many of the calculations presented in the paper are carried out explicitly in the `etc/jacobians.nb` Mathematica notebook.
