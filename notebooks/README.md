# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks in this directory can reproduce most of the plots in the paper. The main ones are:
1. `pol_diagram.ipynb`: produces polarization ellipse diagrams;
2. `jacobians.ipynb`: produces Jacobian plots for different parametrizations of monochromatic, fully polarized modes.

Additional notebooks create animated versions of the polarization diagrams (see `pol_diagram_animation.ipynb`; the others are work in progress).
